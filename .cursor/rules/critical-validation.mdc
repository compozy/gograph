**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** check dependent files APIs before write tests to avoid write wrong code
- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing ANY subtask
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks
**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
